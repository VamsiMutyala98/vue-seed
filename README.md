## Folder Descriptions

- **`/public`**: Contains public files that will be served as-is when building your Vue app. These files are typically static and won't be processed by the build pipeline.
- **`/src`**: The root directory of your application.
  - **`/assets`**: Contains static assets like images and styles.
    - **`/styles`**: Holds the stylesheets for your Vue app, helping you maintain a consistent and organized styling structure.
    - **`/SCSS`**: The root folder for your SCSS (Sass) stylesheets. Using SCSS allows you to leverage Sass features like variables, nesting, and mixins to write more maintainable styles.
    - **`/components`**: Contains SCSS files related to individual components. This structure keeps component-specific styles organized and easy to manage.
    - **`/core-components`**: For SCSS files related to core components of your app that might have a distinct styling structure. Keeping these separate can help maintain a clear distinction between core and custom components.
    - **`/media`**: This folder is for media-specific styles, like responsive designs and media queries, helping you manage styles for different screen sizes.
    - **`/mixins`**: If you're using SCSS mixins to reuse common styles across components, this is the place to store them. This can help maintain consistency and reduce duplication in your codebase.
  - **`/components`**: Reusable Vue components.
  - **`/views`**: Vue components that correspond to different views or pages.
  - **`/router`**: Vue Router configuration and route definitions.
  - **`/types`**: Optional folder for TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.
  - **`/store`**: Vuex store setup and state management.
  - **`/services`**: Services for interacting with APIs or other external services.
  - **`/App.vue`**: The root Vue component that serves as the entry point of your app's UI.
  - **`/main.js`**: The main JavaScript file where your Vue app is initialized.
- **`/tests`**: Directory for your tests, including unit tests, end-to-end tests, and other testing-related files.
- **`/.browserslistrc`**: A configuration file that defines the target browsers for your project's compatibility.
- **`/.editorconfig`**: A configuration file for maintaining consistent code formatting across different code editors.
- **`/.eslintrc.js`**: ESLint configuration file that defines linting rules for your codebase.
- **`/.gitignore`**: A file that specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control.
- **`/.prettierrc`**: Configuration file for the Prettier code formatter, which helps maintain consistent code styling.
- **`/babel.config.js`**: Configuration file for Babel, which is used to transform your modern JavaScript code into browser-compatible code.
- **`/jest.config.js`**: Configuration file for Jest, the testing framework.
- **`/package-lock.json`**: A lockfile that stores dependency information for packages installed from npm.
- **`/package.json`**: The main configuration file for your project, including dependencies, scripts, and project information.
- **`/README.md`**: The README file that provides an overview of your project, its structure, and how to use it.
- **`/tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for TypeScript, if your project is using TypeScript.
- **`/vue.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vue CLI, allowing you to customize the build process and other settings.
